# Team spice girls
## Norms

- What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?
Do you vote? Does the whole group get involved? Do you get someone else to decide?

Two members with the disagreement discuss amongst themselves first. If they can't agree, involve the the group for a vote. if a decision can't be reached, ask for the group fellow to help (who may esclate to others)


- What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
What strategy do you use to talk about it? What do you do if you're the frustrated person? What do you do if you're the person someone is frustrated with?

over communicate - focus on end goal (bigger picture)
if you are frustrated at someone, express the frustration specifically - with an aim towards resolution of the issue. tell them that you are frustrated at them (amd explain why)
    If we are frustrated with another member, we let them know right up front that we have a frustrations related to something they do/said
if you're the person someone is frustrated with, ask for +constructive+ feedback
    When someone brings up a frustration, a constructuve thing to do is to thank then, and listen to their frustration with an open mind. Then try and explain your motivation, with a plan to reduce the frustrating action


- What does this group do when we merge our work together?
Do we do it together? Do we require sign off from someone else?

Initially, we all do it together (review, approve et al)
Eventually, just have one other person approve


- When does this group ask for help?
After 10 minutes? 15? 20? After everybody's tried to solve the problem? What strategies do we use before we ask for help?

15 to the max. Ideally lesser.


- How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?
Do members of a pair decide their own norms? Do they do things like keep a timer to switch positions? How often do we switch partners?

Create issues collectively (as they are needed). Define owners for each issue during the standups daily. Define pairs to work on the review of those issues alongsides with this assignment


- How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?
Is it okay to work on your own after hours? How do we keep the group informed? Do we only work after hours when we can pair? When the entire group is present?

Work on individual issues as needed, as long as one doesn't lose productivity for the next day, and doesn't overwrite existing code, or go beyond the issue allocation defined by the group in the prior standup.
Will overshare (if working late) on the group slack channel.


- What time does this group have daily stand up?
Standup at 10:30 am daily
If we run into the situation where we are done with the issues assigned to us, we will pull from the list (and inform the team).
